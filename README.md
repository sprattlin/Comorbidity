This notebook is designed to analyze and visualize the comorbidity indices of patients over time. 
Comorbidities, or the presence of multiple chronic conditions in a patient, are critical in understanding patient outcomes and guiding treatment decisions. 
By analyzing how comorbidities evolve over specified time intervals, we can gain insights into the progression of a patient's health and the effectiveness of their treatments. 
This notebook uses Matthew Davis' pyelixhauser package to detect ICD codes in the dataset.
